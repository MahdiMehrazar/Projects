# Projects

These are my personal projects.

Prototype Boy is a prototype game I made in Unity using the C# language as a way to improve and test my programming skills.

TicTacToe is a simple Tic Tac Toe game with AI and 2 player functionality I made to improve my Java skills and familiarize myself with Android
